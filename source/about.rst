About this knowledge base
=========================

This is a personal knowledge base built with Sphinx.

The material here benefits from structure: hierarchy over chronology, revision over accumulation, navigation over vibes.

I treat documentation as a product. That means clear boundaries, predictable organization, and an expectation that things will be revisited, corrected, and improved over time.

The documentation contained herein is incomplete, subject to change, and offered with no guarantees, much like its author.
